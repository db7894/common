''' Given a collection of words where one letter has been
removed and the remaining letters have been scrambled, find
the original word and using the missing letters create and
un-scramble the final word. The extra rules are:

* There are hints to what the word can be, but these don't matter
* There is only one overall solution, but many initial solutions
* The final solution has something to do with the initial clues
