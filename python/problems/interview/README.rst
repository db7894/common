Calendar Puzzles

Summary
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of solutions to the puzzles in my puzzle
a day calendar. Suprisingly a number of the questions make
excellent algorithm questions, so I am writing down at least
on or two solutions to the problems that could be good for
interview questions or just for practice.

I am also trying to write as many notes about the problem as
possible so I can mostly hand out the problem (with code removed)
at the next interview loop.
