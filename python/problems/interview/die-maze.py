'''
Given a maze of dice where you are started at a given position
(say upper left), attempt to find a path to the ending position
(say bottom right). The rules are:

* on your first move, you can move vertical or horizontal
* on every following move you must alter the direction
* on each move, you must move the number of spaces as indicated
  by the previous die
* you cannot land on the same spot twice
* you cannot exceed the bounds of the grid
* you must land on the last space perfectly
