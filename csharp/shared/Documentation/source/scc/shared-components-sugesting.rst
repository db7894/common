Submitting Shared Component Ideas
=============================================

Many times, a developer may think up a new idea for a component that has the potential to be shared
by development teams.  Alternatively, they may find an existing part of the code that could be
made generic and thus promoted to a shared component.

In either case, developers are strongly encouraged to submit new ideas for shared components (new or existing)
to the Shared Components Committee at SharedComponentsCommittee@bashwork.com.  The developer should
submit information such as:

* The proposed name of the component
* The purpose of the component
* The need it fills 
* The way it would be used

The Shared Components Committee will then review these submissions and decide on several factors including:

* Can the code be effectively shared?
* What are the benefits and trade-offs of sharing this component vs redeveloping as needed?
* Where should the component live (new or existing library)?
* Who will develop (or tweak if already existing) the component?
* Who will manage the component?

Once these issues are resolved, the SCC will vote on inclusion of the component.  If the component is selected for 
inclusion, a plan will be put forth to move the component into the shared libraries and code review it for the next
release.
