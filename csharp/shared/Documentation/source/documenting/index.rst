========================================
Creating ReST Documents
========================================

The markup used for this documentation is
`reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ project, amended by custom
directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_ to postprocess the HTML output.

This document describes the style guide for our documentation, the custom
reStructuredText markup and how it should be used, as well as the Sphinx build system.

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html
.. _docutils: http://docutils.sf.net/
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

If you are interested in contributing to the documentation, there's no need
to write reStructuredText if you are not so inclined. Plain text contributions
are more than welcome!  Simple send them to the SharedAssemblies outlook group
and someone will format the documentation for you.
