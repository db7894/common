Checking Server Up-Time 
==================================================

*First Method:*
 
Use the command prompt to issue the following command: "systeminfo". This should give you some information about the system, including up time.
 
*Second Method:*
 
Double click on one of the network icons in the right bottom corner of the screen (by the clock). It should bring up the network information window. This window will contain a "Duration" field which is the system uptime.
 
Alternatively, you can get to this window by going to "start -> control panel -> Network (connections)" and double clicking on one of available connections.
